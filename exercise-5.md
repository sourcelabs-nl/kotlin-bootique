## Exercise 5: Using Kotlin in your test code

Last but not least, convert the test code from Java to Kotlin and add a Unit test. As with any type of application, we really, really, really encourage testing. It's just a good idea. We've seen many tutorials and blogs covering interesting features of a language, but using these features for writing tests is generally not covered. The Kotlin-Java interoperability will make this easy for the most part, but there are some things to know about that may help in implementing these tests.

### Write a simple unit test

Let's start out by finally adding a simple unit test. Normally of course we would strive towards sensible (branch) coverage targets, but for now we'll just settle for being able to test one of our components. Let's start by writing a test for the BootiqueController class.

**Exercise** Implement a test class for the BootiqueController

In the `src/main/test` folder the file BootiqueControllerTest should be available. It has no contents yet, this is left for you to provide.

We are going to be using a mocking framework to mock out our dependencies. Spring test conveniently bundles Mockito so let's use that. First thing to do now, is to define the MockitoRunner as the testrunner for your unit test. Add it now.

In java you would do something like the listing below. Define the test class and add the runner declaration to it.

```java
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
```

<details>
<summary>Suggested solution</summary>

In Kotlin we can refer to classes with the double colon notation: `MockitoJUnitRunner::class`

```kotlin
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner::class)
class BootiqueControllerTest
```
</details>
<br>

**Exercise** Define the instance we are testing and the mocks Mockito should inject

We are now going to define the unit we are testing and the mocks required by this unitto function. 

In Java, you could end up with something similar to the listing below.

```java
@InjectMocks
private BootiqueController bootiqueController;

@Mock
private ProductRepository mockProductRepository;

@Mock
private ProductRepository mockBasketRepository;
```

Without just converting (because that is almost like cheating ;), define the same thing in Kotlin.

<details>
<summary>Possible solution</summary>

This is something interesting. Kotlin has a well-defined typesystem that by default does not allow undefined values or variables. This means we need to work around the fact that we cannot initialize the tested class and mocks at compile time -- Mockito provides the mocks and initializes the test class at runtime. Luckily, we have options.

If you copied and pasted the Java code listed above, the conversion would have resulted in something like the listing below. This will work, but it forces you to define the property as nullable `BootiqueController?` when it actually shouldn't be null due to Mockito's magic. Additionally, you'd have to assign a default value of `null` to it, which isn't too pretty.

```kotlin
@InjectMocks
private val bootiqueController: BootiqueController? = null

@Mock
private val mockProductRepository: ProductRepository? = null

@Mock
private val mockBasketRepository: ProductRepository? = null
```

Kotlin defines another convenient way to do this, by leveraging the lateinit keyword. This keyword can also be used for property/field injection at runtime (although in most cases it makes much more sense to prefer constructor or setter injection over field injection, elminating the need for this approach).

In case you are using lateinit you logically have to specify the target type for the variable, as this can not be inferred.

```kotlin
@InjectMocks
private lateinit var bootiqueController: BootiqueController

@Mock
private lateinit var mockBasketRepository: BasketRepository

@Mock
private lateinit var mockProductRepository: ProductRepository
```
</details>
<br>

**Exercise** Write a simple test for the `getBasket()` operation.

To do this, we'd have to use the basketRepository mock, and instruct it to behave in a certain way. This is the test you could possibly write in java:

```java
@Test
public void testRetrieveBasket() {
    final String basketId = "BasketId";
    final Basket basket = new Basket();
    
    when(mockBasketRepository.getBasketById(basketId)).thenReturn(basket);
    
    assertThat(bootiqueController.getBasket(basketId)).isEqualTo(basket);
    
    verify(mockBasketRepository).getBasketById(basketId);
}
```

Now create the Kotlin equivalent.

<details>
<summary>Suggested solution</summary>

The code is not that different from the Java, but there's catch! In Kotlin `when` is a keyword!
Luckily, this was anticipated so in Kotlin we can still use function calls with backticks 
around them. Besides this, it's all the same.

Another interesting possibility is that Kotlin allows you to use whitespace in function names,
as long as you use backticks around them. This allows you to write more expressive test method
names.

```kotlin
@Test
fun `test retrieving basket functionality`() {
    val basketId = "BasketId"
    val basket = Basket()
    
    `when`(mockBasketRepository.getBasketById(basketId)).thenReturn(basket)
    
    assertThat(bootiqueController.getBasket(basketId)).isEqualTo(basket)
    
    verify(mockBasketRepository).getBasketById(basketId)
}
```
</details>
<br>

**Pro-tip if you find you are getting stuck writing the tests in Kotlin: Write the test in java and convert/copy it into a kotlin file. The conversion will be automatic (via a prompt) and can help you to figure out how to write some of the code in Kotlin.** 

**Exercise** Remove the need for backticks around the when

If the backticks around `when` give you a headache too you can write a helper function that encapsulates 
this. The definition for Mockito.when is the following:

```java
public static <T> OngoingStubbing<T> when(T methodCall) {
    return MOCKITO_CORE.when(methodCall);
}
``` 

It is a convenient static function, so we can write a Kotlin function that wraps this and substitutes the
definition of `when` with `whenever`.

<details>
<summary>Suggested solution</summary>

Here's the Kotlin code for that, you could add it to the test sources for convenient usage.

```kotlin
fun <T> whenever(methodCall: T): OngoingStubbing<T> {
    return Mockito.`when`(methodCall) // Delegate to escaped when
}

// Usage
whenever(mockBasketRepository.getBasketById(basketId)).thenReturn(basket)
```
</details>

You can also add a nifty library to your codebase named [Mockito-Kotlin-Library](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin) which enables you to use mockito `when()` as `whenever()` but also has some good functions added to make
testing Kotlin with Mockito a breeze. It just adds some simple syntactic sugar to Mockito anywhere it makes sense to do so.

### Write an application test

**Exercise**: Convert BootiqueApplicationTests.java to Kotlin using IntelliJ (menu > Code > Convert Java File to Kotlin File).

This application stems from [start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io) and because of that it features a test setup already, for application tests. We are converting our codebase to Kotlin though, so that means we can't really leave this one in its Java form. That would just be silly. 

The first step would be to convert the test to Kotlin code, so do so now.

**Exercise**: Modify the test setup for calling an endpoint in the running bootique service

We are going to test the app by calling an endpoint, so we'll be modifying the test. We are first going to tell Spring Boot to start a server (on a random port) and will wire in a TestRestTemplate to call the service.

First, we'll need to configure the web environment to test against. Modify the `@SpringBootTest` annotation like below.

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
```

Secondly, wire in an instance of the `TestRestTemplate` that will be provided to you by spring
when activating the web environment. It will be provided with host and port preconfigured.

```java
@Autowired
private TestRestTemplate testRestTemplate;
```

Adapt the logic above to Kotlin for use in the `BootiqueApplicationTests`.

<details>
<summary>Suggested solution</summary>

Here's the Kotlin implementation for this:

```kotlin
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class BootiqueApplicationTest {

    @Autowired
    private lateinit var testRestTemplate: TestRestTemplate 
```
</details>

Run the setup, the context should load, injection of the `TestRestTemplate` should succeed.

**Exercise**: Add the actual test

Let's define the test. Implement the body of this function, by using the `TestRestTemplate` to call the service.

```kotlin
@Test
fun `test bootique get products endpoint`() {}
```

The `/products` endpoint returns a list of products. In order to employ automatic conversion to List<Product> we can use a class called `ParameterizedTypeReference` which will allowed a typed return value for the template. Consider the following call:

```kotlin
testRestTemplate.exchange("/products", HttpMethod.GET, null, object: ParameterizedTypeReference<List<Product>>() {})
```

This will return a `ResponseEntity<List<Product>>` because the type is enforced thanks to the ParametrizedTypeReference. It is a bit verbose though, and requires the use of an anonymous inner class.

As a final exercise, let's leverage three interesting features Kotlin has to offer: Extension functions and inlining + reified generics.

What if we could define an (extension) function to call an endpoint like this:

```kotlin
val products = testRestTemplate.get<List<Product>>("/products")
```

Extension functions allow us to 'add' functionality to an already existing class. This is no
bytecode magic, but merely some syntactic sugar that creates a function that takes the instance
it is called on as an implicit parameter and exposes it as `this`.

Secondly, we can employ generics, more specifically reified generics, to extract the type from
a generic parameter **at runtime**. Kotlin can inline function code at the call site, eliminating
the need for dynamic calls but also adding some extra flexibility: by inlining the code at the
call site, Kotlin is able to escape from the type erasure that haunts the JVM.

Try to implement an extension function for `TestRestTemplate`, named `get(uri: String)` which
delegates to the `exchange()` method.

For reference, the syntax below shows an extension function on the `TestRestTemplate` type, 
in this case with a void return type. It also defines generics. Modify this call so you can 
call it like listed below.

```kotlin
val products = testRestTemplate.get<List<Product>>("/products") // Usage

fun <T> TestRestTemplate.get(url: String): T {
    return ...
}
``` 

<details>
<summary>Suggested solution</summary>

There are two main modifications required to the method to use reified generics. One is defining
the method to be inlined. You cannot reify generics without inlining, due to JVM type erasure.
We need to apply the `inline` keyword to the function.

Secondly, we need to add the `reified` keyword in the generic declaration, to define our 
intent to reify the generic type.

Having done this, we can now refer to the generic type as usual, but we can also extract the
type at runtime, which means we can actually use `T::class.java` to get the runtime type of 
the class!

Putting it all together, we can now conveniently call get with just the url path, and the specified generic type, like this: `restTemplate.get<List<Product>>("/products")`. We can use the generics to apply to the `ParametrizedTypeReference<T>`. We can create an anonymous inner class for this, for which Kotlin uses this notation: `object: ParameterizedTypeReference<T>() {}`. 

```kotlin
inline fun <reified T> TestRestTemplate.get(url: String): T = this.exchange(
        url, HttpMethod.GET, null, object: ParameterizedTypeReference<T>() {}
).body
```
</details> 

If you were able to succesfully make the changes to the method as listed above, you can then implement the full test like listed below. The (inferred) type for `val products` is `List<Product>`. We should get a result of four products (which is the default number of products when starting the service). Let's do a quick assert that this expectation matches.

```kotlin
@Test
fun `test bootique get products endpoint`() {
    val products = restTemplate.get<List<Product>>("/products")
    assertThat(products.size).isEqualTo(4)
    assertThat(products[0].title).isEqualTo("iPhone X")
}
```

Running it should succeed. This should give you some insight in how Kotlin integrates well with the existing test setup you may already have, how to deal with reserved names and how to write and extension function with reified generics to allow convenient and expressive usage of an injected rest template.

But, if we do not use reified generics and inline the function as we did before, we will lose all type information at runtime! Removing `inline` and `reified` will change the response. Instead of a `List<Product>`, the return type will be a `List<java.util.LinkedHashMap>`. Run the test again, and see that it fails on the assert for `products[0].title`; `LinkedHashMap` does not define a property called `title`. All in all, quite a useful feature, retaining this type information at runtime, which can come in handy when trying to work around the type erasure that haunts Java.

## Bonus exercise ##

**Exercise** As a final exercise we can also test a post, to the products endpoint for example.This shows off the ability Kotlin has to interpolate (multiline) strings. We are going to be testing the endpoint that adds an article to the basket. Take the test below. Notice that is leverages a multiline string, declared with `"""`. As with any string in Kotlin, we can use string interpolation to set values in the string directly. These are visible as `$productId` and `$quantity` as is visible in the example below. Anything that's accessible in the scope of the method is usable for String interpolation. You could also call methods, such as `${productId.toUpperCase()}`.

```kotlin
@Test
fun `add product to basket`() {
    val productId = "1"
    val quantity = 2

    val response = testRestTemplate.postJson<String>("/baskets/1/items", """
            {
                "productId":"$productId",
                "quantity": $quantity
            }
    """)

    assertThat(response.statusCode.value()).isEqualTo(200)
}
```

Now, as an assignment, build the implementation of the extension function `postJson()`. Here's something to get you started. Notice the type of the response is omitted here, and has to be determined in the method call. You can get this to work without modifying the test code, all works needs to be done inside the extension function.

As a hint: reified generics can help you out here too!

```
fun <T> TestRestTemplate.postJson(url: String, json: String): ResponseEntity<T> {
    val headers = HttpHeaders()
    headers.contentType = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON
    val entity = HttpEntity(json, headers)
    return this.postForEntity(url, entity, <CLASS?!>)
}
```

<details>
<summary>Suggested solution</summary>

Reified generics to the rescue again! When using reified generics, you don't only get to hold on to the type information at runtime, as an added bonus you can also extract the class from the generic type, which is nice to define the return type here. Using `T::class.java` will return `java.lang.String` in this case, as we are calling it from the test with `String` as the defined generic type. In this use case it is convenient to have access to this information at runtime.

```kotlin
inline fun <reified T> TestRestTemplate.postJson(url: String, json: String): ResponseEntity<T> {
    val headers = HttpHeaders()
    headers.contentType = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON
    val entity = HttpEntity(json, headers)
    return this.postForEntity(url, entity, T::class.java)
}
```

Please note, we used this:

`this.exchange(url, HttpMethod.GET, null, object: ParameterizedTypeReference<T>() {})` 

in the previous example, why not replace that with:

`this.exchange(url, HttpMethod.GET, null, T::class.java)`

-- The answer is: because we can't. In this case we'll pass in `List` as the expected resulting class, and this will break. Using the full generic type passed to the function as `T` in the `ParameterizedTypeReference` wíll work. This allows us to have a solution that works for domain types such as `Product` and lists of these types such as `List<Product>` alike. Give it a try to see what happens for yourself.

</details> 

## That's it for now ##

That's it, you've done it!

Of course, we are well aware that these tests are somewhat representative of the real-world tests you'll be building, but lack refinement. We hope this will give you the insights you'll need to be able to write some solid tests in Kotlin and at the same time leverage the language features to reduce the volume of code you'll need to write to achieve this.

**So, we encourage you to experiment, experiment and experiment some more. Kotlin might just be that Java replacement you didn't know you'd like so much.**
